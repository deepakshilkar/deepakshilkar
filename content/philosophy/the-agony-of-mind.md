>  **Sartre said**: ‚ÄúAnything, anything would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and never hurts quite enough.‚Äù



Jean-Paul Sartre's quote captures the essence of existential angst and the human experience of grappling with inner turmoil and suffering. I did not understand what he had to say until very recently, when, during my quiet hours, often spent in a park observing the flow of water, it hit me hard!

Sartre was deeply influenced by the intellectual and cultural climate of his time. Yes, perhaps there's nothing to do with the conditioning I have since my childhood or even now. For nearly past 18 years, I was only concerned about survival, making ends meet, helping my parents run the farm while also taking studying. But the question of meaning of life has always bothered me. Not yet whether life has some meaning, but whether there ought to be.

I'm putting the words on paper (metaphorically) because I feel that in the dimly lit corners of our minds, where thoughts linger and doubts fester, there lies a profound agony‚Äîa gnawing, creeping pain that never quite hurts enough to be easily defined. It only surfaces in your weakest hour, and creeps back as soon as you regain strength, passion, and desire. The following write up is based on some of the notes I took while navigating the labyrinth of existential thought.

Think about life as a never-ending play, where you are both the lead actor and the director. At times, it feels like a cosmic joke, and you're not entirely sure whether you're in on it or the unwitting punchline. This is the existential paradox‚Äîthe nagging feeling that life might be a grand improvisation, and you're an actor on a stage without a script.

From the very moment we're born, our existence is a tumultuous journey. Picture a newborn, wailing and demanding attention. It's a raw, primal cry for validation, a symbol of our inherent desire to make our presence felt in this vast world. It perfectly fits with an analogy that I overused in many discussions. Think of a smart phone. The moment you turn it on, the first thing it asks for is your identity and connection to the internet. The moment it is connected to the internet, it would continue to send a ping up and receive a validation down irrespective of whether or not you were using the internet. So in some ways, the internet is like the baby (only in raw sense) who wants validation.

As we grow (in time, but in mind?), we don't outgrow that sense of existential unease; it only transforms into seeking alternate forms of validation. We grapple with questions that don't have easy answers. Why are we here? What's the purpose of it all? It's like trying to navigate a labyrinth with no map, where every twist and turn seems to lead us deeper into the enigma of existence. Again, if you're not bothered by these questions, please don't continue reading because there is nothing like stirring up a storm when there is scope for none.

Sartre's words resonate when he describes suffering as a "creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles." In existentialism, suffering is not an anomaly but a fundamental aspect of our existence. **Please do not relate this to suffering = you need Jesus. Probably he needs Sartre.** We suffer because we possess the gift (or curse) of freedom‚Äîthe freedom to choose, to question, to defy convention. With freedom comes responsibility, and with responsibility comes the potential for suffering. But are we really free, free to choose and question? Or [is it maya]([The Concept of Maya | Vedanta Society of Southern California](https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/the-concept-of-maya/))?



The assertion that "anything would be better" than this mental agony reveals the paradox of our desire for freedom. We yearn for it, yet it's a double-edged sword. Freedom grants us the power to shape our lives, but it also thrusts upon us the burden of our choices. Sometimes, the prospect of freedom can be overwhelming, like standing at the edge of a precipice, wondering whether to leap or retreat. Read [this New Yorker piece]([When It‚Äôs Bad to Have Good Choices | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/bad-good-choices)) to get a taste of wht I am saying.

On a parting note, I'll, leave you with this thought. As you contemplate the abyss of existence, what choices will you make? What meaning will you create? 


Until later...üëã
