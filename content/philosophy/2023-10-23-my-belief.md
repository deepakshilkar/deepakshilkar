I love studying the microscopic and macroscopic realms that construct our reality. My research interests span infectious diseases, aging, molecular imaging, and structural biology. I have previously worked on various research projects, including anti-dengue drug discovery, antimicrobial drug discovery against ESKAPE pathogens, and natural product chemistry. From Western philosophy, I find myself walking the path of José Ortega. In Eastern philosophy, I study Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta. However, my knowledge of these ideas is very basic. This blog is where I share my interdisciplinary explorations, where science and philosophy entwine to pose questions, seek answers, and contemplate the awe-inspiring enigma that is life. Do visit this corner once in a while if you love what I say.

**I treat a path that is between nihilism and existentialism. If you are suicidal or tend to have very ill opnion of the world, read at your own risk. **

> In the vast expanse of existence, the world presents itself not merely as a physical space of land and sea, but as an infinite cemetery, a silent keeper of a billion stories now forever hushed. Each story, a universe unto itself, harbored hopes, dreams, fears, love, and indescribable sorrows, moments of clarity drowned by inevitable oblivion. These narratives, woven into the very essence of what it meant to ‘be,’ thrived on the existential belief of making an indelible mark upon a world that moves unrelentingly forward. Yet, here lies the profound absurdity that existentialists embrace: amidst this eager search for purpose and meaning, all stories, regardless of their fervor or triumph, eventually dissipate into the ether of forgotten tales. This recognition does not beckon despair, but rather a liberating acknowledgment of our transient passage through time, compelling us to live authentically and fervently, for we are the narrators of unwritten stories in a world that will, one day, claim them back into its silent, vast anthology.

*I dedicate this corner to those travellers who are and will eventually be a part of this graveyard.*
