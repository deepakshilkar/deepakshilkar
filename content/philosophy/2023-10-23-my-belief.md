 From Western philosophy, I find myself walking the path of Jos√© Ortega. In Eastern philosophy, I study Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta. However, my knowledge of these ideas is very basic. This blog is where I share my interdisciplinary explorations, where science and philosophy entwine to pose questions, seek answers, and contemplate the awe-inspiring enigma that is life. Do visit this corner once in a while if you love what I say.

**I treat a path that is between nihilism and existentialism. If you are suicidal or tend to have very ill opnion of the world, read at your own risk.**
