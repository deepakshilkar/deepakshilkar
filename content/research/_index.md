> **Note to visitors**: This section use to house all the protocols and minor insights I uncovered while doing lab experiments. Unfortunately, my old WordPress website was poorly secured and also not backed up well, was hacked, and all of myt word was lost. I will put up all the content back as soon as it is recovered. I have recently migrated to Hugo and I am already loving it. 

## Research interests
I love studying the microscopic and macroscopic realms that construct our reality. My research interests span infectious diseases, aging, molecular imaging, and structural biology. I have previously worked on various research projects, including anti-dengue drug discovery, antimicrobial drug discovery against ESKAPE pathogens, and natural product chemistry.
