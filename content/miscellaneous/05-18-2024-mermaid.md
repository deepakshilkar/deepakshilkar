Hey there, fellow papermod enthusiasts! If you're like me, you're always on the lookout for ways to make your Hugo blog content more engaging and easy to understand. That's why I'm excited to share with you my experience of adding Mermaid.js to my Hugo Papermod site using the CDN method. 

Mermaid.js is a fantastic tool that allows you to create beautiful, interactive diagrams and flowcharts right in your web browser. With its simple markdown-like syntax, you can create complex visualizations in no time - no need to be a coding expert or a design whiz! From mapping out project timelines to illustrating technical concepts, Mermaid.js is the perfect solution for anyone looking to add a visual punch to their online content. 

And the best part? It's incredibly easy to integrate into your website or blog, which is exactly what we'll be covering in this post!


# How to 
**Credit: [Joe Mooring](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/jmooring/summary)**

1. Add the following to your `layouts/_default/_markup/render-codeblock-mermaid.html` file:

```html
<div class="mermaid">
  {{- .Inner | safeHTML }}
</div>
{{ .Page.Store.Set "hasMermaid" true }}
```

2. Add the following to your `layouts/partials/single.html` file:

```html
{{ if .Page.Store.Get "hasMermaid" }}
  <script type="module">
    import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
  </script>
{{ end }}
```

# Examples
You could also add the above code to `scrips.html` or `head.html` file. Below are some working examples of mermaid diagrams with UML code taken straight from their site.

## Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it?}
    B -- Yes --> C[OK]
    C --> D[Rethink]
    D --> B
    B -- No ----> E[End]

```
## Sequence diagram

Here is a simple example of a sequence diagram created using Mermaid.js based on the book [Bulletproof Problem Solving](https://bulletproofproblemsolving.com/) by Charles Conn and Robert McLean. By the way, I highly recommend this book if you're interested in improving your problem-solving skills!

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Problem Solver
    participant D as Define the Problem
    participant B as Break It Down
    participant I as Prioritize Issues
    participant A as Conduct Analysis
    participant S as Synthesize Data
    participant V as Develop Solution
    participant C as Create Action Plan
    participant M as Implement Solution
    participant R as Review & Iterate

    P->>D: Identify Problem
    D->>B: Decompose
    B->>I: Sort by Importance
    I->>A: Analyze Parts
    A->>S: Gather Insights
    S->>V: Formulate Solutions
    V->>C: Plan Implementation
    C->>M: Execute Plan
    M->>R: Assess & Refine
    Note over R: Iterative Process. Review outcome. Make adjustments
    Note over D: Start Here. Clear definition critical
    Note over I: Prioritize based on impact      
```
## Class diagram

Here is an example of a class diagram created using Mermaid.js:

```mermaid
---
title: Animal example
---
classDiagram
    note "From Duck till Zebra"
    Animal <|-- Duck
    note for Duck "can fly\ncan swim\ncan dive\ncan help in debugging"
    Animal <|-- Fish
    Animal <|-- Zebra
    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()
    Animal: +mate()
    class Duck{
        +String beakColor
        +swim()
        +quack()
    }
    class Fish{
        -int sizeInFeet
        -canEat()
    }
    class Zebra{
        +bool is_wild
        +run()
    }

```

## State diagram

Here is an example of a state diagram created using Mermaid.js:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> First
    First --> Second
    First --> Third

    state First {
        [*] --> fir
        fir --> [*]
    }
    state Second {
        [*] --> sec
        sec --> [*]
    }
    state Third {
        [*] --> thi
        thi --> [*]
    }
```

# Sankey

This method did not work for `js-sequence-diagrams`. I guess I'll have to try using a different approach and include the library instead in the static files. 

Until next time, happy blogging! ðŸš€
